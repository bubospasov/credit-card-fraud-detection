# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict fraudulent credit card transactions based on historical transaction data. The dataset contains various features of transactions, such as time, amount, and anonymized information about the customer and transaction. The goal is to classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data) from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where there are 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions.
